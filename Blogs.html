    <p>Clarification: This blog page reflects my personal perspective on learning mathematics. You can either agree or disagree.</p>

    <p>My favorite book (which is given to the green hand in algebraic topology) is "Algebraic Topology from a Homotopical Viewpoint" by M. Aguilar et al.</p>

    <p>Recently (Aug. 2023) I have been working on model category and infinite category (as "languages") and spectral sequences.
